# Robert McArthur's Research Work

This repository stores a record of Robert McArthur's research work.

Work is organised by directory, with a short explanation in each one.

## Works in Reverse Chronological Order

### TreeTOP

TreeTOP is Robert McArthur's honours thesis which he completed under the supervision of Prof. Gavin Huttley, Dr. Yu Lin, and Dr. Ahad N. Zehmakan.
It relates to an efficient method for reconstructing time-oriented phylogenetic trees.
That is from the DNA sequences of a collection of organisms, finding a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree that displays their evolutionary relations through time (an NP-Hard problem).

Robert McArthur presented parts of this work at an international conference (Phylomania) in 2022 and 2023. In 2023 he was awarded best-talk for a component of the algorithm that solved what took previous state-of-the-art ~7000 seconds in only ~30 seconds (with better accuracy too!).

Robert McArthur is currently working as a research assistant for Prof. Gavin Huttley, making further improvements and aiming to publish two papers from this work.

### CEGARBox

CEGARBox is a state-of-the-art theorem prover for modal logic. In this work, Robert McArthur, under the supervision of Prof. Rajeev Goré, extended the theorem prover to handle all 15 normal modal logics, as well as multi-modal logic and tense logic.

Further extensions by Prof. Rajeev Goré and others are underway prior to publication.

### Evolutionary Composer

In this work, Robert McArthur combined autoencoders with genetic algorithms for the purpose of music composition under the supervision of Dr. Charles Martin. He created an application which allowed users to easily compose new music using this method. A paper on this work was published in EvoMUSART 2021.
