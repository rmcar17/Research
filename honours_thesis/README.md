# TreeTOP

TreeTOP was Robert McArthur's honours thesis.

The honours thesis presents three new algorithms in the field of phylogenetic reconstruction.

It is still under further development and papers will soon be published from this thesis. Stay tuned :)

Original code is at <https://github.com/rmcar17/TreeTOP>, though a cleaner and installable version will release with the papers.
