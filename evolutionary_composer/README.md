# An Application for Evolutionary Music Composition Using Autoencoders

In 2020 as a second year undergraduate student I completed my first research project under the supervision of Dr. Charles Martin.

The project combined a genetic algorithm with autoencoders to generate music.

Autoencoders embedded a collection of video game music and, by perform evolution over the latent space of the autoencoder, the application allows users to evolutionarily compose new music.

We published our work in EvoMUSART 2021 [1]. The paper is in this folder, and the application can be found at <https://github.com/rmcar17/Evolutionary-Composer-With-Autoencoder>.
